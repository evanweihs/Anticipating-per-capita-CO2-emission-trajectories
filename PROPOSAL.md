# Project Proposal

## Anticipating per Capita CO₂ Emission Trajectories

## Motivation
Reducing carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions is a central objective of climate policy.
However, emission levels and trends differ significantly across countries due to
differences in economic development and energy structures. Per capita CO₂ emissions
provide a more relevant metric for cross-country comparisons than total emissions,
as they better reflect the carbon intensity of economic activity.

## Research Question
Can historical economic and energy data be used to anticipate future trajectories
of per capita CO₂ emissions at the country level?
